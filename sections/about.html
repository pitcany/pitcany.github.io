            <span>Welcome!</span> My name is <span>Yannik</span> and I am a
            <span>senior data scientist</span> working on
            <span>artificial intelligence research</span> at an
            <span>R&D consulting company</span>. Before that, I earned my
            doctorate in statistics from UC Berkeley where I did research on
            theoretical machine learning advised by Dr. Peter Bartlett. This
            is a place where I share my thoughts on statistics, data
            science, and anything else that I fancy. Feel free to explore
            and learn more about me and my work!
